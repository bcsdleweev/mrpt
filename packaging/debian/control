Description: Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit - Documentation and examples
 The Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT) is an extensive, cross-platform,
 and open source C++ library aimed to help robotics researchers to design and
 implement algorithms in the fields of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping 
 (SLAM), computer vision, and motion planning (obstacle avoidance).
 .
 The libraries include classes for easily managing 3D(6D) geometry, 
 probability density functions (pdfs) over many predefined variables (points 
 and poses, landmarks, maps), Bayesian inference (Kalman filters, particle 
 filters), image processing, path planning and obstacle avoidance, 3D 
 visualization of all kind of maps (points, occupancy grids, landmarks,...), 
 Graph-SLAM, Bundle Adjustment, etc.
 Gathering, manipulating and inspecting very large robotic datasets (Rawlogs)
 efficiently is another goal of MRPT, supported by several classes and 
 applications.
 .
 The MRPT is free software and is released under the GPL. 
 .
 This package provides the documentation and examples of MRPT, and the book
  Writing Scientific Applications with the Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit 
  in .ps.gz format.
